# WeatherPy

Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

[WeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# Observations

* Latitude vs Max Temperature shows normal distribution as the equator middle point.


* Latitude vs Humidity tends to behave normal distribution as the equator middle point.


* Latitude vs Cloudiness shows constant correlations.


* Latitude vs Wind Speed shows that wind is picking up in Northern hemisphere comparing Southern hemisphere. Less windy around the equator.
